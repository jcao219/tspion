## Intro ##

**Platform:**
Windows XP/Vista/7

This program is written in D.
It uses a global hook to record keystrokes.

Just an experimental project made in two nights.

Interestingly this does not seem to require administrator privileges on Windows 7.

## Notice ##
This software is NOT to be used for purposes that invade other people's privacy.
This software comes with absolutely NO warranty whatsoever.
You are responsible for how you use this software.
Most important notice of all: Ctrl-Shift-Alt-S to shut this program down.

Some antivirus programs may detect this as a keylogging malware.  That's okay because this program doesn't hide its keylogging capabilities at all (other than being compressed with UPX, but what modern antivirus does not have the UPX unpacker builtin?).
